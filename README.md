### thoughts on 'markdown'

I'd *rather* be coding in, writing these web pages, the mark**up** language of the hyper-text ... rather than in/with (at my first intro & use of) this 'markdown', wiki-ready, grammar.

Yes, John Gruber's [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) work is impressive (dig that favicon ![Daring Fireball: Markdown](http://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip2/daringfireball.net.ico)) 

So: be careful with those exclamation...'marks'?  As well with the asterisks, brackets, ...

 - Here's a good start to "[**Master**ing Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)" (it's a page in [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)
 - Also, Jaime Moran's [Markdown Live Editor](http://jrmoran.com/playground/markdown-live-editor/) is useful.
